### 1. System Overview
The system will transform the current paper-based loans and savings management system at Dilla University into a modern web-based platform. The system needs to handle:
- Salary-based savings (5% of salary)
- Loan management with 3% monthly interest
- Savings interest calculation (7.9% on savings)
- Integration with Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE)
- Two CBE account management (Savings and Usage accounts)
- Restricted access for Dilla University teachers and civil servants only

### 2. User Registration and Verification System

- Employment Contract Number
- Current Salary Information
- Bank Account Details (CBE account numbers)

#### 2.2 Registration Process Flow
1. User fills out registration form with required information
2. System validates university email domain
3. User receives email verification link
4. After email verification, account enters "Pending Approval" state
5. Admin notification generated for new registration
6. User sees "Waiting for Admin Approval" dashboard until approved

#### 2.3 Admin Verification Process
1. Admin receives notification of new registration
2. Admin dashboard shows:
   - All pending registrations
   - User submitted documents
   - Employment verification status
   - Salary information verification
   
2. Admin Actions Available:
   - Approve Registration
   - Reject Registration
   - Request Additional Information
   - Flag for Review

3. Verification Steps:
   - Cross-check employee ID with HR database
   - Verify employment status
   - Validate salary information
   - Confirm department/faculty
   - Verify bank account details

4. Post-Approval:
   - User receives approval email
   - Account becomes active
   - Full dashboard access granted
   - Savings deduction can begin

#### 2.4 User Dashboard States

1. Pre-Approval Dashboard:
   - Registration status
   - Verification progress
   - Required document status
   - Contact support option
   - Additional information requests

2. Post-Approval Dashboard:
   - Savings overview
   - Loan eligibility
